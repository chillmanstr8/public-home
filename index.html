      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Over fifteen years of professional experience in Information Technology, with a wide range of knowledge and hands-on experience in release engineering, product implementation and maintenance, and quality assurance testing. My career goal is to continue as a Build & Release Manager. I have shown that I can be effective in making sure deadlines are met and the integrity of the release is always solid by using milestone checklists. My ambition with build & release technologies is automation â€“ creating a continuously integrated environment which is always ready to deliver with minimal set up and manual error checking. As an integral part of DevOps methodologies, I possess a deep understanding of the need for the Release Manager to be involved with various department heads each day, as well as contact with the Project Managers to ensure the client is delivered what they are expecting on time, without error.</p>
      <p>Goal-oriented technology engineer with a wide range of experience in many settings and OS's. Forward-thinking when reviewing project requirements to determine precise solutions. Composed professional when working under tight schedules and limited budgets to achieve innovative designs meeting and exceeding objectives.</p>
